Week 1:-
	we had started gathering the sources from which we can study about DES and also lookout for various IDE which can fits best for our project
	
week 2:-
	 we had seen that many files in our system is in normal text format and doesnt secure if the person had bypassed the login also many college sets a common login so that student doesnt face any difficulty while login so we felt that we should develop some program that can secure these files on system level


week 3:-
	we felt that every system in our lab has been installed with JAVA thats why we had decided to choose java as a platform. As java provides platform independency our program can be shifted from one system to another using no time and no extra modifications

week 4:-
	fig:- DES ALGO

	DES works by encrypting 64 bit of message using 64 bit key and generates 64 bit cipher message
	this cipher message is stored on local machines which is in non readable HexaDecimal format
	
	this same cipher message is used in process of decryption along with same 64 bit key

week 5:-
	we had started implement DES and we had faced lot of issues as we have to convert whole data in hexaDecimal and Binary
	we had learned several ways to convert the data

week 6:- 
	we had successfully developed the function that will encrypt the data
	in this week we had developed the function that will decrypt the data as well as some frontend part

week 7:- 
	in this week we had linked our DES function with our frontend part and did some testing 
	while testing we had came to know about the issues that are present in the program 
	and tried to overcome it
